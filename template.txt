Welcome to COSP, your new future Android Operating System.
Our goal is to have an Pixel-like android ROM that isn't spying on you and uses as few system space as possible. Also, we provide the option to go completely without GApps using MicroG support.

Why us?
[HIDE]We are focusing on stability and performance, having an debloated ROM is essential for that. Also, we want Users to decide what kind of Store they want to use, either F-Droid or the Play Store.
Also, we take User requests serious. To suggest something, contact us on [URL="http://t.me/cospcommunity"]telegram.[/URL][/HIDE]
